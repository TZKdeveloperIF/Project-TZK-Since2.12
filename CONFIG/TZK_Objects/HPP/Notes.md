#Anims, Vehicle Actions and MovesMC
CfgVehicleActions defines variables as string. It'll be called in "moves" of the man unit, which links to specific CfgMovesMC class.  
Thus it'll be necessary to define some vehicle actions in all CfgMovesMC including default CfgMovesMC provided by BIS config.bin and costumed by addon maker.
+ Vehicle Actions of Tiger Helicopter, for example.
#Tanks
Tanks are equipped with driver/gunner "Can See Radar". This is not OFP feature but seems welcomed by many ppls. And due to OFP clumsy vehicle simulating, we don't have to insist BIS designs.
##M60
The direction of BIS M60 Indicator RPM is wrong. Should be ivversed.
