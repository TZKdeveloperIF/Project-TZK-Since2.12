Main content is from BIN\StringTable.csv of 2.01 ArmA:Resistance. It's necessary to remain infomations there, since file structures is little different from 1.99, and many Chinese players use unique language MOD made many years ago (before 1.99 has been released) with modified BIN\StringTable and Dta\Fonts.

Some informations is modified, however. 2.01's StringTable modified many units' name comparing with 1.96/1.99, but many players still get used to old ones.

NOT RECOMMEND TO EDIT stringTable.csv DIRECTLY VIA notepad. HEX EDITOR IS RECOMMEND.
