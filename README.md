# About Project TZK
The master branch of TZK MPMissions (not MOD) version is 1.00→1.01→1.02→1.10→2.00→2.11→2.12→4.0.0→4.0.3 (latest).  
There're 2.10 and 3.00 (with corresponding 3.01 trial) version MPMissions but they're failure. There're **No Response Server** problem remain unsloved in these 2 version. The reason probably due to "portable satchel" of which the "magazineType" is the only one modified parameter. This problem is solved by 2.12 v08 version.
2.00 is inspired by SE mod of TZK, and started to add new units, set new functions like spoof missile or afterburner, introduce new effects and upgrade the basic mission setting. Effects introduced into 2.00 mainly inspired by another Chinese MOD naming "ETON". Besides, "Join" and "Temporary Order" are the most important designs made in TZK_2.00.  
Since 2.12 the 2.01 Arma Resistance by [4RTech] is applied. Many new features are realized with the help of new script commands supported by Arma Resistance. The most conspicuous improvements are the simplify in mission.sqm and available flexible local radio channel working as supplement of OFP crude action list.   
In 4.0.0 many models are modified to support **multiple texture**, textures are change-able in-game. TZK divide islands into 4 features: *Common, Desert, Green (wood) and Winter (snow)*. In different feature islands, those vehicles will display different texture. Another main work of 4.0.0 is the introduction of **Artillery Module**.
## 2.01 ArmA:Resistance
2.01 is very useful to TZK. It provides many basic script commands. With the help of 3D-direction command, the author makes MP-stable visual effects. 2.01 also support editors editing strings. Combining magazinesArray, GetWeaponParam and GetWeaponSubParamArray, one can precisely check units ammunition and whether it's out of some weapons' ammo. Dynamic creating of markers, waypoints and triggers make mission.sqm tiny and editors able to design flexible radio channel system as an enhancement of the action list. And we might expect more, both for TZK and for 2.01.
# Gain MPMissions from Scripts on GitHub Directory
It's strongly recommended to use batch processing to copy files and make PBOs. The *MakePBO* of **Mikero Tools** is powerful.  
1. "xcopy" all files from "General Mission Scripts" to each folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)".  
+ For extend version basing on TZK (like MFCTI mod, TZK_SE mod, etc), using batch processing to "xcopy" files from their external folders as well.

2. Package each folders in "mission.sqm(and Extra folder)" to PBO files.  
In old version MPMissions some pictures like .paa or .JPG are placed in missions' folder. They aren't uploaded to github, and hence files won't be included in source codes and pictures won't display in YOUR missions, but the game is able to play without them. Since 2.12S MPMissions read pictures from MOD (I moved them out of the mission), and MPMissions folder on github include scripts only.
