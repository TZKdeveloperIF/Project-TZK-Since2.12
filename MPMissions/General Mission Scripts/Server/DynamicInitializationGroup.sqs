; Town and Worker Groups are displayed on map, thus they're defined in mission.sqm, not created in-game and broadcasted.
; Temporary group and join group should be global, and are placed in mission.sqm as well.
; Res town groups and patrol groups can be created by the server. So do AA groups.
; Pre-defined west/east town groups should be attached to flagCarriers. Redundant groups should be deleted and insufficient groups should be created, and those created group remain NOT broadcasted.
; For broadcasting, publicExec or "Init" parameter of "createUnit" is available.



; ==================================Town Groups==================================
; Groups are recorded in init.sqs thus have to wait unitl game started. 
; Number of town groups should rely on number of towns.
