There're too many plane in CTI using same model and equipping different weapons. It'll be good if players can custom the weapon they like. Also this can be applied on other vehicles.

# Script
For those SQF scripts aiming to initial variables, we can apply "preprocessFile" but not "loadFile" on them to remain quote info.
# Vanilla support
~~This system is designed defaultly to fit vanilla and even 1.99 version. However in 2.01 it's possible to control the ammunition so a better design will appear in later (than 4.0.5.16) version.~~  
Since 4.0.6 TZK stop supporting 1.99 or vanilla.
# Plane
There're actually 3 kinds of plane in CTI. If use AA-only and able-to-scan-ground units then there're only 2.
# Gunship
There're too many gunships with different kind, price, AT proxy, etc. It's trivial work to apply this system on them but I've managed to made it.
