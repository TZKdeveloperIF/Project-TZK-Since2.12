# Airport
It seems that the position info of airport should be defined in the wrp file. Planes can autoland in everon, malden, nogova and some 3rd-part islands but can't in intro or cain.
# Bridge
AI units can recognize islands defined in wrp but can't recognize bridges created in-game via script command.
# Ship Speed
Generally AI ship will move at the speed 60km/h. However in some islands (ctilica, ofland, etc) the water seems to be too shallow for AI ships to move and they'll drive only in 15km/h
## 2.01 command "setWaterLevel"
This script command can't solve ship moving speed problem.
