In current commit a new variable "pvMatchRuleDefined" is defined for taking place of condition "isNull (mhq select _si)". However even create server by game directly the just-created vehicle's position seems incorrect. Thus scripts relying on exactly mhqs' position still require this condition.
But this condition is still not exactly, through. Players often found themselves spawn in the air on game start.
