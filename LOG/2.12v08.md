### 2.12 v08_v6
Change Truck5TRefuel in **InitUnitTypes.sqs** to Truck5tRefuel, for the function "GetUnitTypeFromObject" applying find command, which is cASe-seNsItiVE.
### 2.12 v08_v5
Adjust the PlayerOrder matrix.
+ **Clear Order.sqs** is placed under Order folder.
+ Adjust the way scripts initialize Order and Order New works.
	+ Calculate the uid first, then write corresponding (id+1) into **Order\New.sqs**.
	+ The **Order\New.sqs** will write passed id or current id + 1, depends on how many parameters are passed in. This will prevent same series scripts write different id.
	+ The orderCheck uses uid to gain the id.

Adjust the "shoot target" command.
+ The initialization of order should be executed in concrete scripts but not the starting script.
+ Make further exploration of this design.
	+ HeliHEmpty isn't a good target. AI can't see it and thus can't aim exactly even though "reveal" is applied. And AI can't detect the change of its position.
		+ Not verified yet, but this probably is same for game-logic, since it has same simulation and model.
		+ Use HeliH instead. And set its damage 0 when reset its position.
	+ The "fire" command is legal, if its 2nd parameter (of weapon) match its 1st one (of vehicle). However "actual fire" require more (i.e., the existence of gunner and the loaded magazine). This make the "fire" command sometimes deviate the "actual fire". Furthermore, if the "fire" command is executed at the moment unable to "actual fire", the AI will aim down (depends on the "minElev" of that weapon), and when the frame able to "actual fire" comes, AI will shoot immediately, which is possible hurt itself.
		+ Apply 2.01 command to gain "reloadTime" of a magazine (actually this is a mode parameter).
		+ For reloading magazine's situation. the magazineReloadTime of a weapon should be gained (actually this is a muzzle parameter).
		+ There's another known special situation. If a vehicle is "addMagazine" by script without a gunner, it'll cost many time to load that magazine (probably the reloadTime is equal to a "skill = 0" gunner). If "fire" command is executed when reloading, AI will miss this shoot, and may hurt itself.
			+ Apply 2.01 command to remove current magazine (which will make the weapon "unloaded") and add that magazine to weapon again.
				+ The "ammoArray" command will return the name and ammunition of *current* magazine, and "addMagazinePrecise" can return the magazine precisely.
		+ Of course the design should exit the script just before "fire" if gunner seat is empty.
	+ doWatch objNull can remove the effect of "doTarget". doWatch the position of the target (HeliH here) can improve this design.
		
Fix the bug in **EquipmentCalculateCost.sqf** which missed defining weapons _unit.

_setting = aiSetting select _si select _gi still report error. Maybe in AI_CheckBoard the gi is "find" and cause the error. Adjust the design.

Add the design of "Infantry Mode", remove tanks more expensive than $1800 and aircrafts more expensive than $5000. Edit res armor as "BMPRes". Make it impossible to upgrade TGH.
Ask AICO_CheckBuyUnit check the bool of infantry mode.

Adjust "Server\CheckRearm.sqf". In script the "Gun" and "Sabot" aren't pre-defined.
+ The vehicle must have a type of "light tank, heavy tank or howitzer (not art tanks which only equip heat but not sabot).
+ Use some 2.01 command to gain its "sabot" magazine. Some priori assumption is required, i.e., the main gun is the 1st weapon and the sabot is its 1st magazine.
+ Only when gi is legal will the script check aiSetting. In old design the illegal parameter giTown is passed in and thus report the error.

Fix the bug that spectator don't create game-end trigger.

Remove some unnecessary scripts.
### 2.12 v08_v4
Fix bug in **AddRearmData.sqs**. The condition of "_this" 's count should be compared with 1 not 0.
Fix bug in **MsgUnitBuilt.sqs**. The wrong setting cause only siRes set data into the array.
### 2.12 v08_v3
Missed ")" in **Watch.sqf**.  
"busyClear" require defined "_si" in scripts, and this is missed in **Server\Loop\AI_CheckRide.sqs**.  

## 2.12 v08
Remove portable satchel in server scripts.
+ Remove the usage of portable satchel in AI_CheckDropBomb. In order scripts only check whether AI have "magSatchel".
+ Units join the server via "Join" design or because of player's disconnecting will be cleaned up its portable satchel.
+ Remove the portable satchel from soldiers' equipping scripts and AI leader's equipment. EAST sniper AT soldier equipping SVU-A instead of SVD.
+ Portable satchel is still available to players' group.

Adjust Res and Town Groups.
+ Recover their design, mostly modified since v04 for experiments. The period of loop is assigned as 30 seconds without random.
	+ Delay is remained in those ergodic parts.
+ Adjust the hibernate design. Unnecessary to delete units/vehicles, instead, repeatedly creating and deleting may be more expensive.
	+ Create some markers on players' clients.
	+ When players received the hibernate/spawn info, those markers will be placed/removed at the town flag to indicate the town is safe zone or not.
		+ Markers are available to CIV as well.
	+ When hibernate, TG will receive reinforce as general. When reinforce ready, TG will return to the hibernate check and do nothing but just halt.

Adjust the LOOP design.  
The author found the "crash" (not no-response) problem become more frequent when applying loop design.   
After having add delay on the beginning of loop scripts the problem solved. Probably the release of last script cost some time.

The script of AI_Commander still use old design without loop.  
Adjust the way AICO buy units in dev mode (dev ON in training MPMissions in everon and Freya_CTI island).

Adjust of AICO
+ The author found AI seldom stay home when loop design applied.
+ However on destroy part AI groups still can't do the "patrol co9 (whose position is at enemy MHQ)" well.
	+ They still have to be asked go to the closest town to enemy MHQ.
	+ Old design using a bool variable, which is binary. New design use a number and adjust the design into ternary.

*(This part is the by-product of researching "no-response" problem. Modifications here aiming to improve the mission. Although they probably don't relate to that problem, they're valid for some improvements and thus are remained.)*  
The author use "setFriend" command of 2.01 and found the "no-response" won't appear if nobody killing each other.  
The reason is no one will attack by portable satchel. However, the author used to thought the reason is because of too long unitMatrix/RearmData array.
+ The adjust of UnitMatrix is abandoned.
+ The adjust of RearmData is remained. Traditional design use a long array to record ALL units created in CTI.
	+ A unit with fixed type has a fixed equipment. Thus we can design an empty array whose size same as "unitDefs" to restore the equipment of each type.
		+ The elements of this array, "rDataMatrix", is array.
			+ The format of the element array is "[id, weapons[], magazines[]]"ï¼Œthe No.0 element indicates the priority.
		+ The **AddRearmData.sqs** will write data with priority "0".
		+ The **Equip** scripts will write data with priority "1".
		+ The **UpgState** script will write data with priority "2".
		+ Empty array will always be wrote. Otherwise the script will check the priority. Only when priority is "2", or priority more than existed data, will the script write.
	+ Units with undefined type (group leaders), custom soldiers and structures will use traditional design, i.e., be recorded into a long array (which won't be so long as before).
		+ They'll be distinguished by **AddRearmData**, if it received more than 1 parameters, and the second one means "type" of unitDefs.
	+ The record of resistance soldiers into RearmData is canceled. And only west/east town vehicles' equipment data will be writed by "EditEquipRearmData".
	+ Adjust **EditEquipRearmData.sqs** and **EditRearmdata.sqs** to fit new design.
	+ Adjust **GetRearmData** to fit new design. Many scripts using SQS syntax to get RearmData are recovered to use SQF as well.
	
Adjust the briefing.html. Parts of texts using handwriting.  
Remove the reducing of DOOM.  
Use "EffectBullet0_xj200" bullet for Fired Effects instead of Bizon bullet.  
Recover those functions from string to SQF. No obvious signs that string is better than SQF and help solving "no-response" problem.  
Fix the bug in dialog Equipment that missed loading Binocular and NVG.  
Removed the hint when worker repairing structures set in v07.  
Set Town Triggers' scripts as loop design. Attention, the "closestTown"'s side shouldn't be assigned as "siRes" only like before.  
Remove some SQS syntax searching unit's type. Recover the usage of SQF.  
Fix the "buy better NVG" channel. The binocular and NVG is removed from magazines and be treated as weapons in equipment system, but this script didn't adjusted.  
Fix the KnowsAbout scripts using wrong variable name.  
Set RallyPoint and PickupWait of AI as loop design. The number of their setting is passed in as a parameter. Set PickupWait don't keep on doing busySet and busyClear.  
In dialog spectator, the carrying system using 15 for groups and thus causing bug. It's adjusted and using "GroupsNum" now.  
Set a bool for CIV to turn ON/OFF the markers displaying. This bool can be set by marker in dialog or by 0-0-9 channel in 1st mode.  
Managed to realize the 1st mode. "switchCamera", "cameraeffect" and delay is necessary.  

Next step the author will mainly research the Server FPS. And the author now know how to test misisons better.
