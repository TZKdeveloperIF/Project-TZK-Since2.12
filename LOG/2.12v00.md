# Version
Use "v00" to record the version. Wish to finish this project within 100 times updating.
# Marker System
It's unnecessary to update the position of all units in one cycle. The main 2Hz loop should include common units only. Enemy aircraft units should update 1 time per second, and should be checked among aircrafts. As for structure, their marker should be placed when being built, and the loop should only check whether they are null or not, and remove (place outside the map) those deleted objects' marker.
## UpdateUnitMarkers.sqs
Since the player and spectator passing different parameters, it's unnecessary to ask them using same script. Actually scripts should be decoupled, and not all markers' refresh requiring SQF.
### MappingUnitsPlayer.sqf
Remain marker displaying of leaders, group members, side units and side vehicles here. And since the markers of town/worker groups have different color, it's unnecessary to hide them when selected displaying unique groups' marker.
### PlayerStruct.sqs
The markers of structures are decoupled with Marker Tower. The reason is simple, that structure is immovable, and players are always able to marker them by themselves.

Structures' marker will be created on their being built. The cycle is 30 seconds, and check whether null or not. For those destroyed ones, they should be black.

Markers of enemy's structures requiring satellite spying position. Since it cost more gaining type from specific object, the better way is remain the markerPos and markerType but just set its size to [0,0].
### PlayerVehicleEnemy.sqs
The cycle is 1 second. 
### SpectatorMarker.sqs
Reduce the frequent refreshing structures, resistance/civilian vehicles.
### GroupIsAI.sqs
When a player disconnect, its marker name should recover to groups' name
# Map Click of Unit
The script judge the distance between clicking position and unit's position. However what affect player's decision is the marker's position. Thus it's necessary to use the marker's position.
