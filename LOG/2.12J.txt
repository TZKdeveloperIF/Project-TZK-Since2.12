2.12I cause no-response server again. The reason might be "discontinuousâ€œ id between groups and vehicles, or the application of "createGroup".

Those closed playable roles is deleted in games thus the author think discontinuous can lightly be the problem. 

2.12J will try pre-set enough groups without using createGroup. Groups won't be removed by deleteGroup as well, to prove discontinuous ID stable. Leaders will still be deleted by deleteVehicle.


Groups
0: Res Group with init information.
1-18, 19-36, 37-46: playable roles
47-50: groupTemp and group Join
51-75: 25 Preset west TG
76-100: 25 Preset east TG
101-125: 25 Preset guer TG
126-135: 10 Presed guer patrol group
136-143: 4*2 Preset worker group
144,145: Start Position
So class Groups should set Items = 146


Init.sqs
Add an array "groupName". The format of its element are all string. They're the first 4 letters(in UPPER case) of group's name, which indicating the side. The comparison of string in OFP is case-insensitive.
This array can be used to judge a group's side. The "side" of a group might return "unknown", e.g. a new created group by "createGroup". With the help of "substr" editors can gain the actual side by the name of a group.

"townGroups" is enlarged to 3 rows.

Server\DynamicInitializationGroup.sqs
Res Town Groups not created as well.

Not to create AA groups(for trial. Not to use createGroup in 2.12J).

Not to remove redundant groups and members.
