    + No command returns whether a magazine is reloaded in specific weapon of a unit/vehicle.
+ Get turret direction
    + No command returns the 3D direction of a vehicle turret
    + In some mods (like MCAR) a trick is applied that models have cargo proxy in turret selection and they'll filled by "logic" object to make it able to calculate turret info
+ Set turret direction
    + No command to assign vehicle's turret direction
